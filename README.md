# Gagggle: AI-Augmented Collaborative Whiteboard

An intelligent whiteboarding platform that supercharges creativity through AI-powered ideation, real-time collaboration, and seamless idea manipulation.

## üéØ Vision

Gagggle transforms the traditional whiteboarding experience by eliminating "blank page anxiety" and accelerating the ideation process. We combine the spatial freedom of tools like Miro and FigJam with powerful AI capabilities that generate, expand, and synthesize ideas in real-time.

## üöÄ Problem We're Solving

Traditional whiteboarding tools require manual ideation and organization, leading to:
- Slow start times and creative blocks
- Manual effort in grouping and iterating on ideas
- Limited creative exploration and combination of concepts
- Inefficient brainstorming sessions

**Our Solution:** AI-augmented ideation that jump-starts creativity while maintaining the flexibility of manual collaboration.

## üîÑ User Journey

1. **Start** ‚Üí Create new board or select template
2. **Prompt** ‚Üí Enter ideation prompt (e.g., "Ways to improve user onboarding")
3. **Generate** ‚Üí AI creates 6-10 initial idea sticky notes
4. **Expand** ‚Üí Click any idea to generate sub-ideas and details
5. **Combine** ‚Üí Select multiple ideas for AI-powered synthesis
6. **Collaborate** ‚Üí Invite team members for real-time editing
7. **Annotate** ‚Üí Add drawings, arrows, and manual notes
8. **Export** ‚Üí Save and share results in various formats
